				<h3>Announcements</h3>
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						We're happy to announce the UTG Winter 2015 Lecture Series, bringing the top researchers in UofT's CS theory group to give an open lecture on topics ranging from cryptography to distributed algorithms. Everyone is invited - only basic mathematical understanding required! Click on Events on the sidebar to view the dates and talk abstracts.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
				<p>
					The purpose of the group is to introduce its members to the various subfields in Theoretical Computer Science. Presentations take place to educate group members on terms and concepts related to these subfields, with the purpose of increasing awareness about past, current, and potential research directions. Weekly
					group meetings are used to accomplish this purpose, as well as to serve as a breeding ground for ideas and to stimulate discussions.

					<h4>Prof. Faith Ellen - Concurrent Data Structures</h4>
						<p class="desc">Wednesday January 21st 4-6PM at BA 1170: A concurrent data structure is a data structure on which multiple 
processes can act simultaneously. Otherwise, it is called a sequential 
data structure. A library of concurrent data structures can make the task of developing concurrent software much easier. Although sequential data structures can be transformed into concurrent data structures in straightforward ways, the results are generally inefficient and/or not fault tolerant. I'll discuss some of the difficulties and techniques involved in constructing efficient concurrent data structures, including my recent work on balanced binary search trees.</p>
<hr>

<h4>Prof. Charlie Rackoff - Cryptography</h4>
						<p class="desc">Thursday March 5th 4-6PM. Details will be added soon.</p>
<hr>

<h4>Prof. Allan Borodin - Conceptually simple algorithms: the what, the why, and the why not.</h4>
						<p class="desc">Friday March 20th 4-6PM: In many applications, there are factors that go beyond computational efficiency. One such factor is the conceptual simplicity of the algorithm. For example, in auctions, buyers prefer easy to understand how mechanisms for allocating and pricing items.

But what is a conceptually simple algorithm and at what cost (in performance, accuracy, efficiency) does it come? An ambitious research agenda  would be to try define such a concept and study inherent tradeoffs. A more realistic agenda is to focus on the ``algorithmic paradigms'' that we study in courses such as CSC373. 

To that end, what is a greedy algorithm, local search, dynamic programming? When are such algorithms successful and when not? And does such introspection lead to new algorithms? We will present a brief introduction to this more modest research agenda.</p>
